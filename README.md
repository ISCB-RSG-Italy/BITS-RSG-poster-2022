# BITS-RSG-poster

We created a survey to collect data about the perception of bioinformatics among Bachelor, Master, PhD students, and recent graduates in STEM disciplines. The results of this survey allowed us to draw a picture of the current scenario of bioinformatics in Italy, as well as to gain insights into how bioinformatics curricula could be improved to provide better training for next generations of bioinformaticians. We presented the collected data in a poster session during the 18th Annual Meeting of the Bioinformatics Italian Society (BITS).
